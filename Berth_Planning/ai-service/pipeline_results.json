The significant historical average delay of 9.6 hours for this vessel, combined with the 75% confidence score, indicates potential berthing slot conflicts or operational constraints that typically affect this bulk carrier's port calls.\n\n**Recommendation:** Given the vessel's deep draft (12.5m) against JNPT's 14.5m channel depth, coordinate immediate pilot boarding and tug assistance while monitoring current tide levels to ensure adequate UKC for safe berthing operations."

The feasibility score of 0/100 reflects the fundamental incompatibility between vessel type and berth designation, as container terminals lack the specialized equipment and safety systems required for tanker operations (liquid cargo handling arms, vapor recovery systems, spill containment).\n\nThe vessel should be directed to JNPT's liquid cargo berths at the Liquid Cargo Terminal, which are specifically equipped for tanker operations and comply with international safety standards for hazardous cargo handling."

However, operational constraints have significantly impacted allocation feasibility, with only 2 out of 9 vessels (22%) receiving viable berth assignments. This low feasibility rate indicates critical capacity constraints at JNPT, likely due to a combination of berth occupancy, vessel-berth compatibility mismatches, or resource availability limitations. Immediate attention is required to address the 7 pending vessels through alternative scheduling, resource reallocation, or consideration of anchorage holding patterns to prevent port congestion.",
