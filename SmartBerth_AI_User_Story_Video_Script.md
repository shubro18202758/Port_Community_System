**Objective:** Demonstrate all core SmartBerth AI features through a realistic user journey, with emphasis on AI/ML functionalities

---

## Script

### SCENE 1: The Morning Challenge
**Timestamp:** 0:00 – 0:08

**Screen:** SmartBerth AI login → Dashboard loads

**Voiceover:**
> "It's 7 AM. Priya has 12 vessels arriving in the next 48 hours, 3 berths freeing up, and a vessel that's been delayed by weather. Let's see how she handles it."

---

### SCENE 2: Upcoming Vessels — AI Predictions in Action
**Timestamp:** 0:08 – 0:32

**Screen:** Upcoming Vessels dashboard with 7-day vessel list

**Voiceover:**
> "Priya starts with Upcoming Vessels. The list is sorted by AI-predicted arrival — not what shipping lines declared, but when our ML model actually expects them."

**Screen:** Hovers over vessel "MV Northern Star" — prediction breakdown appears

**Voiceover:**
> "She hovers over MV Northern Star. The AI shows its prediction reasoning — current position contributing 40%, weather impact 25%, historical route performance 20%, channel congestion 15%. Predicted arrival: 2:45 PM, 47 minutes later than declared."

**Screen:** Clicks "Get AI Berth Suggestion"

**Voiceover:**
> "She clicks Get AI Berth Suggestion. The system evaluates all 10 berths against this vessel's constraints."

**Screen:** AI suggestion panel appears — Berth 6A recommended, confidence 94%, reasoning displayed

**Voiceover:**
> "Berth 6A is recommended. Confidence: 94%. The reasoning is clear — draft requirement met, LOA within limits, crane 3 available, no tidal restrictions for this window. Priya accepts with one click."

**Screen:** Real-time alert confirms allocation

---

### SCENE 3: Full-Year Calendar — Strategic View
**Timestamp:** 0:32 – 0:42

**Screen:** Toggles to Full Year view

**Voiceover:**
> "Before moving on, Priya checks the full-year calendar. March shows 47 declared vessels — the highest this quarter. She makes a mental note to plan crane maintenance around the February lull instead."

**Screen:** Calendar with monthly vessel counts visible

---

### SCENE 4: Vessel Tracking — Real-Time Positioning
**Timestamp:** 0:42 – 0:58

**Screen:** Clicks Vessel Tracking in nav bar — 2D map loads

**Voiceover:**
> "Switching to Vessel Tracking, Priya sees every inbound vessel on a live map. Real-time positions updated continuously via AIS."

**Screen:** Hovers over a vessel approaching the port

**Voiceover:**
> "MV Pacific Horizon is 28 nautical miles out. Declared ETA was 11 AM. AI-predicted ETA is 11:52 AM — the model detected speed reduction due to headwinds. Priya now has an extra hour before she needs that berth ready."

---

### SCENE 5: Berth Overview — AI Insights Per Berth
**Timestamp:** 0:58 – 1:12

**Screen:** Clicks Berth Overview tab — all 10 berths displayed

**Voiceover:**
> "The Berth Overview shows all 10 berths. Green for available, blue for occupied, grey for maintenance. Each berth card shows AI-generated insights — allocation factors, compatibility scores, current status."

**Screen:** Clicks on occupied Berth 4 — vessel details expand

**Voiceover:**
> "Berth 4 has MV Ocean Carrier. ETD is 3 PM. Cargo: 2,400 TEU containers. Draft: 12.8 meters. The AI flags this vessel is on track for on-time departure — no alerts."

---

### SCENE 6: Digital Twin — Drag, Drop, Validate
**Timestamp:** 1:12 – 1:38

**Screen:** Clicks Digital Twin — 3D terminal renders with berths, vessels, anchorage

**Voiceover:**
> "Now the Digital Twin. Priya sees her terminal in 3D — every berth, every vessel currently berthed, and three vessels waiting at anchorage."

**Screen:** Drags vessel from anchorage toward Berth 7

**Voiceover:**
> "A new vessel just cleared customs. Priya drags it from anchorage toward Berth 7."

**Screen:** Green validation — constraint checks pass, vessel drops onto berth

**Voiceover:**
> "The AI runs instant constraint checks — cargo compatibility confirmed, vessel dimensions within limits, no scheduling conflict. Green light. Vessel assigned."

**Screen:** Drags different vessel toward Berth 2 — red error appears

**Voiceover:**
> "She tries another vessel on Berth 2. Red flag — draft exceeds berth maximum by 1.2 meters."

**Screen:** Clicks chatbot icon — types "Why can't this vessel use Berth 2?"

**Voiceover:**
> "One question to the AI chatbot explains the conflict in plain language and suggests Berth 9 as an alternative."

---

### SCENE 7: Gantt View — Time-Based Berth Availability
**Timestamp:** 1:38 – 1:50

**Screen:** Clicks Gantt tab — horizontal timeline with berth blockages

**Voiceover:**
> "Finally, the Gantt view. Priya sees berth blockages over the next 72 hours — each bar showing when a berth is occupied based on predicted departure times. Berth 4 frees up at 3 PM. Berth 6A at 8 PM tomorrow. She knows exactly when she can slot incoming vessels."

---

### SCENE 8: Closing — The AI Advantage
**Timestamp:** 1:50 – 2:00

**Screen:** Dashboard overview with floating chatbot visible, then fade to SmartBerth AI logo

**Voiceover:**
> "Twelve vessels. Three berth changes. One weather delay. Zero manual rework. Priya's morning took fifteen minutes — because SmartBerth AI handles the complexity so she doesn't have to."

**Screen:** Logo with tagline — "Predict. Allocate. Optimize."

- Ensure all hover states and tooltips are captured clearly
- Keep the floating chatbot visible throughout as a passive presence

### Per-Scene Notes

| Scene | Recording Note |
|---|---|
| Scene 2 | Ensure prediction weightage tooltip is fully visible on hover |
| Scene 2 | AI suggestion panel should show confidence score and at least 3 reasoning points |
| Scene 4 | Hover on vessel should show both declared and predicted ETA clearly |
| Scene 6 | Show one successful drag-drop (green) and one failed (red) |
| Scene 6 | Chatbot response should be visible for at least 2 seconds |
| Scene 7 | Gantt should show at least 3 berths with different blockage patterns |

### Audio

- **Music:** Subtle, modern electronic background track
- **Music volume:** ~20% of voiceover level
